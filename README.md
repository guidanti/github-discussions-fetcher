  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ get x number of discussions
  | â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”´ for each discussion
  |   â”œâ”€â”€ more than 100 comments in discussion?

  |   â”œâ”€â”€ group comments into batches
  |   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ”´ for each group
  |   | â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ get replies for all comments (BULK)
  |   |   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”´ for each comment
  |   |     â”œâ”€â”€ more than 100 replies in comment?
  |   |     | â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ get remaining replies for comment
  |   |     â””â”€â”€  push replies to comment
  |   â””â”€â”€ return discussion
  â””â”€â”€ more than 100 discussions? loop from the start
```

## TODOs

- [ ] Efficient bulking (see section below)
- [ ] Refactor using Effection and add incremental backoff

## Efficient Bulking

The workflow outlined above would work well if there are fewer discussions with high number of comments:

```json
{
  "discussions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "comments": 1000,
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "comments": 1000,
    }
  ]
}
```

The data above would require approximately 21 queries.

However, if we have a high number of discussions with few comments:

```json
{
  "discussion": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "comments": 1,
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "comments": 1,
    },
    ... 1000 more discussions
  ]
}
```

This would require approximately 1011 queries.

To anticipate the second scenario, we would need to batch the comments at a level higher so that we can group the comments across multiple discussions:

```diff
.
  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ get x number of discussions
  | â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”´ for each discussion
  | | â”œâ”€â”€ more than 100 comments in discussion?
  | | | â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ get remaining comments for discussion
- | | â”œâ”€â”€ group comments into batches
  | | â””â”€â”€ return discussion
+ | â””â”€â”€ take every comment of all 100 discussions and group them into batches
  |   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”´ for each group
  |     â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ get replies for all comments (BULK)
  |       â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”´ for each comment
  |         â”œâ”€â”€ more than 100 replies in comment?
  |         | â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ get remaining replies for comment
  |         â””â”€â”€  push replies to comment of the correct discussion
  â””â”€â”€ more than 100 discussions? loop from the start
```

> We're testing with [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions?discussions_q=) which has ~22,000 discussions. From a sample data of 1300 discussions, the average comment count was 8. So that should bring us to around 1,760 points for each ingestion.
